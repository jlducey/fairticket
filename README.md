## Fair Ticketing Code Repository
To get our White paper, watch for link, coming soon.

Reseach and recent coursework in;
* DevOps
* C++, Golang
* AWS and serverless computing.
Developing Ethereum based smart contracts in Solidty with Truffle, Mocha and Chai.
>Smart apps require Web3 interfacing with web apps, proficient in HTML5, Javascript, jQuery and learning React.
White paper and crowdfunding coursework.

>After experimenting, found that the most productive language choices for our ticketing web app development purposes were the HTML5 ones, consisting of; HTML, Javascript, and CSS. Combined with Bootstrap they will handle Android easily. Looked at C++ for speed when scaling out, but Go is easily a better choice. Go was built to scale, lends itself well to being the backend development language for the ticketing project.

PostgreSQL was the obvious choice for a database, it is fast, scales well and has pure Go drivers that worked well first try.

Tickets consist of human readable information as well as a QR code embedding whatever information we need to put in it. We can easily generate tickets via HTML5. 


## Major Components

HTML5 QR writer
HTML5 QR reader
Backend Database System

For interactivity the demo links are to others live websites, will have the ticket writer up on our website.

Smart contract development is being done with solidity, ethereum-testRPC(Ganache), truffle and chai. Remix is handy for quick tests as well. Found that Solidity language is simple enough, but there are not a lot of complete examples of common crowdfunding clauses with data and explanations. Given the incredible financial impact of a bug in an ICO contract, looked at ICOwizard, Zepplin and other ICO contracts to clarify how some of the clauses work. The best example so far is the RLC one, it is the basis for our ICO contract. Following a succesful issue, funds would go to a multisignature escrow account.

## Small Apology
Sorry about the mix of files in here. Developed with Eclipse editor for C++, Perl, Python, Java and Javascript in the past. Used a local NT-CVS repository to track changes and keep code safe, most my projects has were under NDA's. Started working with Golang and Solidity and found that the Eclipse package for Golang was terrible when compared to Atom and MS Visual Studio. Both the editors have excellent support for Golang, Visual Studio is the best Solidity editor I have found so far. Both editors integrate easily with Github. Files were local then pushed to Github, may create a new repo with branches to isolate code, time permitting. However I have saved from both Atom and Visual Studio and its made some overlap and some extra files.
