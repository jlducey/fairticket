AFter a lot of experimenting, found that the most productive language choices for ticketing web app development purposes were the HTML5 ones, consisting of; HTML, Javascript, and CSS. With Bootstrap they could be used with Android easily. Looked at C++ for speed when scaling, but Go is easily a better choice. Go was built to scale, lends itself well to being the backend development language for the ticketing project.

PostgreSQL was the obvious choice for a database, it is fast, scales well and has pure Go drivers that worked well first try.

Tickets consist of human readable information as well as a QR code embedding whatever information we need to put in it. We can easily generate tickets via HTML5. 


## Major Components

Smart contract development is being done with solidity, ethereum-testRPC, truffle and chai. Remix is handy for quick tests as well. Found that Solidity language is simple enough, but there are not a lot of complete examples of common crowdfunding clauses with data and explanations. Given the incredible financial impact of a bug in an ICO contract, we looked at ICOwizard, Zepplin and other ICO contracts to clarify how some of the clauses work. The best example so far is the RLC one, it is looking like the basis for our ICO contract. Following a succesful issue, funds would go to a multisignature escrow account.
